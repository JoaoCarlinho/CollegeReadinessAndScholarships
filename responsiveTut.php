                        <h3>Get a hold of your Future</h3>
                        “Plan Your Life: Youth Career Expo” is a fun, engaging and informative career expo designed to inspire Franklin County youth to work toward career goals and PLAN FOR LIFE. The target groups are middle and high school students.
                        The expo will provide youth with a rare opportunity to explore a multitude of career options in one stop. Since middle and high school students relate better to their peer group, the expo will be ever more engaging as the workshops, panels and exhibits will be conducted primarily by college students. These students will come from various student organizations of local universities including The Ohio State University, as well as interns from skilled trades and other industries. Additionally, there will be plenty of professional adults in attendance. The event will not only include careers that require a college degree, but careers that foster training in a particular skill set. The areas of study will be so diverse that there will be something for every student on every level of academic and skill interest.
                        When students leave this event they will understand the importance of a career and how to plan for it. The event is being facilitated by a collaboration of businesses and organizations that are genuinely concerned about shaping the future of youth in Franklin county. I would like to invite you to participate in this very necessary inspirational event. The following is an outline of the tentative careers that will be represented.
